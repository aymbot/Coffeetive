# Coffeetive

Coffeetive is an app that should facilitate the tracking of coffee + mood for everyday users. This app was done for a project at our university.

## Installation

One can simply open the apk file on their phone, but it is to be noted that this APK is not signed, so a lot of devices will warn the user before installation. Else can copy the source files (or clone the repo) and open it via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Usage

There are 3 major fragments:
### Home
### Mood 
### Statistics
